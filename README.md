# Facemaskdetection
🎯 Built a Real-Time Face Mask Detection App Using Computer Vision & Deep Learning!
Over the past few days, I explored how to combine OpenCV and a custom-trained CNN model to create a real-time mask detection system — one that runs live through a webcam. 📷💻
🧠 What it does:
Detects faces using Haar Cascades (OpenCV)
Classifies each face as "Mask" or "No Mask" using a CNN trained in TensorFlow/Keras
Works in real-time with webcam video feed
Displays colored boxes and labels around detected faces 🔴🟢
📦 Trained with a small custom dataset and plan to scale it for better accuracy!
👉 For privacy, I tested and captured results using sample images and webcam footage without showing my own face. (You can still see how the model works visually, thanks to overlays and detections!)
📌 Tech stack:
 Python | OpenCV | TensorFlow/Keras | Haar Cascades | Colab
💬 Would love to hear your feedback or ideas to improve it!
