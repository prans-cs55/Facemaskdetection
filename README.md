# Facemaskdetection


🎯 Built a Real-Time Face Mask Detection App Using Computer Vision & Deep Learning!

Over the past few days, I explored how to combine OpenCV and a custom-trained CNN model to create a real-time mask detection system — one that runs live through a webcam. 📷💻



🧠 What it does:
Detects faces using Haar Cascades (OpenCV)
Classifies each face as "Mask" or "No Mask" using a CNN trained in TensorFlow/Keras
Works in real-time with webcam video feed

Displays colored boxes and labels around detected faces 🔴🟢

📦 Trained with a small custom dataset and plan to scale it for better accuracy!

📌 Tech stack:
 Python | OpenCV | TensorFlow/Keras | Haar Cascades | Colab
💬 Would love to hear your feedback or ideas to improve it!
